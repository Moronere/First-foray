This is the developer's log for the new game made by Moronere and Xan1x. Dates are in the format YYYY/MM/DD.

Developer's log, 2023/08/17:
 We made a new Trello board (https://trello.com/b/ETi3npQv/project-e-production-board) and added the important links to it. Moronere updated the engine to UE5, and only cried a moderate amount. Xan1x set up a bunch of documentation in preperation for the run we have scheduled for the beginning of next week. Xan1x is initially planning these to be on a weekly basis.  It will be the first of (hopefully) many, so we're making sure we have the administrative foundation now so that we don't have to get bogged down setting things up later. There's still busywork to be done, but the framework is in place.

Developer's log, 2023/08/21:
 Today we reviewed the combat system. In a design meeting, we fleshed out the proposed combat system a bit more. Anton made a head for our first character model. Tomorrow he plans to make a body. He struggled with the nose, but feels especially proud of the ears. I fixed an age-old bug with the camera, and had a small panic when I realized we lost some work with the update to UE5. The sword attack animation is gone, and the inventory prototype is missing, possibly some data structures as well. Tomorrow I will need to recreate these, as I want to create a silhouette material for the dummy (to use in animating and some skills) and before I do that, attacks and things to animate have to be done.

 Today, Xan1x got the feet, legs, and posterior of a base character model done. He has started on the hands, and all considered, it's coming along well! :) Moronere began remaking the combat system after a good hour of grappling with the dreaded realization that many of the changes made in years past have become corrupted, and are forever gone. As the horrifying sensation passed, he came to terms with the grim reality, and set out to create a better system than the one we had before.

 Today, Xan1x looked at more boobs than he ever had before in his life. He stared and stared, and consulted with an expert pervert (no names will be named) to get the chest of the female model just right. He completed the body, and it is more or less complete aside from the wendigo claws that we are calling feet. Moronere continued work on the inventory system, doing research and implementing different prototypes. Along the way, he discovered yet more things that were deprecated by UE5. Every single action mapping and axis must be converted to be compatible with the new system, and some deprecated functions have to be gutted and replaced entirely. This combined with the corrupted assets, and we are up to 2 hours solid of him crying in a corner. From Ue5, specifically.
