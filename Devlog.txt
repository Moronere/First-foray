This is the developer's log for the new game made by Moronere and Xan1x. Dates are in the format YYYY/MM/DD.

Developer's log, 2023/08/17:
 We made a new Trello board (https://trello.com/b/ETi3npQv/project-e-production-board) and added the important links to it. Moronere updated the engine to UE5, and only cried a moderate amount. Xan1x set up a bunch of documentation in preperation for the run we have scheduled for the beginning of next week. Xan1x is initially planning these to be on a weekly basis.  It will be the first of (hopefully) many, so we're making sure we have the administrative foundation now so that we don't have to get bogged down setting things up later. There's still busywork to be done, but the framework is in place.

Developer's log, 2023/08/21:
 Today we reviewed the combat system. In a design meeting, we fleshed out the proposed combat system a bit more. Anton made a head for our first character model. Tomorrow he plans to make a body. He struggled with the nose, but feels especially proud of the ears. I fixed an age-old bug with the camera, and had a small panic when I realized we lost some work with the update to UE5. The sword attack animation is gone, and the inventory prototype is missing, possibly some data structures as well. Tomorrow I will need to recreate these, as I want to create a silhouette material for the dummy (to use in animating and some skills) and before I do that, attacks and things to animate have to be done.
